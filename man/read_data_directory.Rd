\usage{
read_data_directory(
  directory_path,
  map_fxn = purrr::map_dfr,
  read_fxn = readr::read_csv,
  filename_as_var = FALSE,
  exclude_files_regex = NULL,
  include_files_regex = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{directory_path}{path to the data directory}

\item{map_fxn}{the map_fxn to use; defaults to map_dfr which is ideal for creating a dataframe}

\item{read_fxn}{the function used to read in individual files; defaults to readr::read_csv}

\item{filename_as_var}{a logical for whether or not the filename should be stored as a variable; defaults to FALSE
this can be helpful if individual data files do not have variables that can be used to distinguish the files from each other}

\item{exclude_files_regex}{a regex that can be used indicate which files in a directory to exclude; defaults to NULL in which case all files are read}

\item{include_files_regex}{a regex that can be used indicate which files in a directory to include; defaults to NULL in which case all files are read}
}
\value{
data return depends on map_fxn
}
\description{
Read a data directory to a data frame or a list
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
directory_path <- "Data"
#to read the data into a data frame
df <- read_data_directory(directory_path, purrr::map_dfr, haven::read_csv)
#to read the data into list
data_list <- read_data_directory(directory_path, purrr::map, haven::read_csv)

#with defaults you can also just read data from csvs to a dataframe
df <- read_data_directory(directory_path)
}
